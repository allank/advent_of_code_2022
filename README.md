[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Code here is refactored, not necessarily what I hacked together for the original submissions.

Possibly interesting bits:

 - Trying to remain within the standard libraries
 - WIP shell script for setup, as well as for running tests and generating final output
 - Unit tests with the samples provided
